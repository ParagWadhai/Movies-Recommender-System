# Movies-Recommender-System

Creating a movie recommender system in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and data science involves leveraging various algorithms and techniques to analyze user preferences and movie features. This includes preprocessing movie data, engineering relevant features such as genre and actors, and applying recommendation algorithms like collaborative filtering or matrix factorization to generate personalized suggestions.
As for the movie dataset, it typically contains information about various movies such as titles, genres, release years, directors, actors, ratings, and user reviews. This dataset serves as the foundation for training the recommender system, enabling it to understand the characteristics of different movies and user preferences. Common sources for movie datasets include IMDb, MovieLens, Netflix Prize dataset, and Kaggle. These datasets vary in size and complexity, providing a rich source of information for building and testing movie recommender systems in data science projects.
